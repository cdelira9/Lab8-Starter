### How are Graceful Degradation and Service Workers Related?

Graceful degradation is a design principle which ensures that a system will continue to function, specifically its core features, even when its componenets are not being supported. Graceful degradation aims more for the site's basic functionalities to continue working allowing for user to still be able to use the site. This relates to service workers as they allow a web application to continue operation for users even when network is unavailable or slow. Because of this, service workers follows the principle of graceful degradation as users are able to continue to use the web application's core features despite network disruptions allowing for a good user experience. And as the graceful degradation principle states the system continues to functions despite the network disruptions.
